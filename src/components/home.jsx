                    <p>Hello!  Iâ€™m Brooke and I am here to teach you how to code.
                        This is an ongoing project that will continue to grow
                        with time and include many more topics!  I will go over
                        them slowly - step by step, with added solutions and links
                        to videos for more explanations. Feel free to submit a form
                        link if I foolishly gave anything that is outdated or incorrect. :D
                    </p>
                    <div className="nav-buttons">

                    </div>
